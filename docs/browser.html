            <p>Upon the invention of the world wide web, it brought upon a war between multiple companies to become the most technologically advanced and most profitable browser. Among those companies was Microsoft, headed by Bill Gates. He had envisioned that the average person could have personal computers at home with his company’s Windows operating system. The business model at the time was to make profit off of customers who would pay to join the Microsoft network in order to access information. However, unbeknownst to Bill Gates, a war would start as a results of a major breakthrough from a company called Netscape with its very first product, Netscape Navigator, a multiplatform browser that a bunch of young computer programmers had designed as a graphical web browser where the user could point and click, making it much more user friendly.
            </p>
            <p>With the help of rich and well known entrepreneur and computer scientist, Jim Clark, and the co-author of Mosaic, Marc Andreessen, Netscape was founded in 1994 under the initial name Mosaic Communication Corporation, soon renamed as Netscape Communication Corporation in the same year.  It was the first company to attempt to capitalize on the world wide web. When it launched Netscape Navigator, it was an instant success and was the most widely used web browser, causing its competitor, Microsoft, to completely shift their focus on developing a web browser.
            </p>
            <p>According to Netscape, Microsoft would arrive at their doorsteps to give them an ultimatum. The deal was supposedly 1 million dollars for its intellectual property or Microsoft would simply copy their code and crush Netscape. Microsoft denies having made such an unsavory offer, but if proven true, it was an illegal act of the antitrust law, which was put in place to prevent giant companies such as Microsoft from becoming a monopoly of the industry. This would be the beginning of an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, in which Microsoft was ultimately ruled against as guilty of committing monopolization.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, although Netscape had not made actual profits, its co-founder, Jim Clark, urged the company to go public, and its opening day was a legendary day. It was so successful that the success of this IPO subsequently inspired the use of the term “Netscape moment” to describe an IPO that signaled the dawn of a new industry. Microsoft kept a tight watch on Netscape’s progress, and a bitter rivalry between the two companies began. Microsoft would make it its mission to destroy Netscape. Microsoft concentrated on developing Internet Explorer, its answer to Netscape Navigator. Ultimately, the difference between Microsoft and Netscape that allowed Microsoft to emerge from the Browser Wars as the final victor was that Microsoft was a giant company that had already established streams of revenue that Netscape did not have. While Netscape had to charge its users for the use of its browser, Microsoft was able to offer the browser for free and integrated into their Windows operating system. Upon the release of Internet Explorer 4.0, Microsoft famously threw a party in San Francisco and its employees dumped a large letter “e” logo in the front lawn of Netscape, marking the end of Netscape’s glory days. Netscape was then acquired by America Online, and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer became the most used web browser, replacing Netscape Navigator.
