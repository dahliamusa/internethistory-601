            <h1>History of the Internet</h1>
            <p>
                Perhaps arguably one of the most important inventions of the 20th century that would eventually impact billions of lives today was the internet. At the internet’s core foundation, it is essentially a type of communication performed between computers. This concept of communication between computers would indirectly come about as a result of a singularly important event, which was the launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957 by the Soviet Union. It was this moment that scared many Americans into thinking that the Soviets could win the Cold War. With the Soviet Union’s flex of technology, Americans started to worry about what might happen in the event a Soviet attack was launched on the nation’s telephone system, cutting all communication. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower would be spurred on to authorize the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in response to the launch of Sputnik. It was within this agency that the concept of computer communications would slowly become a reality.

                At the time, computers were used as stand alone machines. One of the most important figures in computer science, Joseph Licklider, proposed that a network of computers could talk to one another and could share information. Such a network would allow for an alternative way to communicate even if the telephone system went down. Two key figures in this quest for actualizing that proposal were Leonard Kleinrock and Paul Baran. Kleinrock contributed the queueing theory, which is the idea that packages of data would line up at nodes of a network and by implementing the techniques of demand access and distributed control, it could increase the speed of the network. Baran’s contribution of the principle of sending information from one computer to another via “packet switching” was also essential. By breaking down data into packets before sending it to its final destination, each packet could take its own route along the network to the destination. This was an essential difference between computer communications and the telephone system.

                Another influential Internet pioneer was Robert Taylor. In 1965, one of the computer projects that was popular within ARPA was time-sharing in which users could work at a terminal to share a single large computer. However, he was faced with a dilemma where he needed three terminals in order to connect to three time sharing systems. He wanted to build a network that would connect these projects together by letting him communicate to all of them through one terminal. The solution to this problem would be the foundation of the ARPANET project, the government’s first wide area packet-switching network with distributed control to be implemented with the TCP/IP protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ARPANET project started with the building of the IMP, or interface message processor. Special hardware and software was needed in order to send data as it was different from the telephone, which was only designed to send voice. Frank Heart from the company BBN would lead a group into creating a four-node network between four identical IMPs at UCLA, Stanford University, University of Utah, and UCSB.  They were able to successfully establish a network. This would eventually lead to the development of multiple networks and the need for the TCP/IP protocol to interconnect networks, allowing the internet to become a worldwide network.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the final pieces of the puzzle would come from Tim Berners-Lee, who created the foundation of the internet as we know it today as the world wide web, which was an internet that made sending files more user friendly and also allowed anyone to retrieve information. This invention along with Congress deciding that the web could be used for commercial purposes in 1992 was the start of the era rushing in the popularity of the internet.
