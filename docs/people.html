            In the initial stage of the Internet, media companies determined what content and information was available to users. The Internet largely consisted of websites and information that were static and uncollaborative. This version of the Internet is often referred to as Web 1.0. The Internet has since evolved into a platform where users can interact and even create their own content. The term Web 2.0 is used to refer to this current state of the Internet which emphasizes social media and user-generated content.

            In 1999, a music sharing site called Napster was developed. On Napster, users could post their MP3 files to the and other users would download the files to their own computer. Napster created a new kind of user experience; users had the power to generate their own content and began establishing online communities around their common music interests. Users became active and engaged participants to the internet rather than passive recipients of information. As the content of the site was determined by user uploads, it could not easily be regulated. Napster was causing the music industry to lose profits because what users should have been buying from stores was being distributed over the Internet at no cost. Companies feared that this would be the end of protection for intellectual property. There was little that could be done to regulate the distribution of copyrighted music on Napster, so the site was shut down. Since then, there have been numerous other sites created that embrace the idea of user-generated content, and although companies try to take action to protect digital and intellectual property, it cannot be completely controlled.

            The shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 became more apparent with the development of MySpace and Facebook. In MySpace, users create personal profiles where they can express themselves through images, music and message posts. The users are essentially given their own piece of the Internet that they can use and decorate according to their likes, and users can then view the personalized and expressive profiles of other users. Founders of the site described it as a similar experience to visiting someone’s apartment. Facebook is similar in that it also wanted to reflect human connectedness online. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, explained that his objective in creating the site was to map out the social graph, a theoretical web of relationships that connects every person to everyone else. With Facebook, Zuckerberg wanted to create a diagram of this web. These ideas were new at the time and they began the Internet’s progression toward what it is today.

            The original concept of the Internet was that both users and producers could both contribute to its content, and in Web 2.0, we are seeing that happen. Wikipedia is an example of a site that enables this two-way interaction, as it lets regular, unpaid users collectively author the site’s articles. Web 2.0 sites give users the ability to contribute to the Internet in a meaningful way.
