                In the late 1990’s, the Internet experienced extreme growth. It is believed that there are two technologies that facilitated its growth: Moore’s law and Metcalfe’s law. Moore’s law recognizes that the speed and power of integrated circuits, which are used to develop computer chips, doubles every 18 months as technological advancements enable them to become denser and more powerful. Moore’s law caused engineers to feel obliged to continuously deliver better integrated circuits and thus better computer components. Metcalfe’s law describes how the Internet gathers momentum as more users join. When new nodes are added to a network, the network’s value increases exponentially. As the Internet grows, its usefulness increases and even more users are compelled to join.

                Companies saw the growing prevalence of the Internet as an opportunity for business. After the initial successes of few online companies, many more online startups emerged and investors began putting money into these dot-com companies’ stocks. It became widely believed that any online company could be profitable, and as a result, online companies were being built by people with little background in software development or business. Companies also engaged in heavy spending due to the “get big fast” strategy that was popularized by some successful companies, including Amazon. The idea of “get big fast” was to lower profits and invest in marketing in order to gain a user base. This meant that companies’ focus was on rapid growth rather than profits. As a result, many of these dot-com companies were buying advertisements and promotions without generating much profit, believing that they were investing in the future success of their companies. The growth in data traffic encouraged telecommunications companies to build expansive fiber optics networks. There was soon more fiber optics than was needed. Its worth was decreased, so the telecommunications companies were at a financial disadvantage, too.

                One of the final pieces of the puzzle would come from Tim Berners-Lee, who created the foundation of the internet as we know it today as the world wide web, which was an internet that made sending files more user friendly and also allowed anyone to retrieve information. This invention along with Congress deciding that the web could be used for commercial purposes in 1992 was the start of the era rushing in the popularity of the internet.
