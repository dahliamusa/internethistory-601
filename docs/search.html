            <p>With the invention of the world wide web and a Browser War looming in the background, another important part of Internet history is how search engines came to be. At the forefront of this effort were the founders of Yahoo!, Jerry Yang and David Filo. Both were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University who wanted to use the internet to win a fantasy basketball league. In the process, they created a website called “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web” as a directory to other websites, organized in categories and sub-categories. It proved to be popular, and with investments from a venture capitalist, the company, Yahoo!, was created.
            </p>
            <p>One of Yahoo’s biggest dilemmas from the start of their company was on where they would generate revenue from. At the time, the internet was thought of as an utopia of free thinking and academia, unconfined by the capitalistic world. However, Yahoo could think of no other way to make money but to include banner advertisements from sponsors on their website, which they feared would suffer backlash from their users. Luckily, its users continued to use Yahoo regularly, and with the advertisements, Yahoo demonstrated it was possible to profit off the internet. And yet, with all the success they faced, Yahoo was far from perfect.
            </p>
            <p>It was during this time, Larry Page, a young graduate student at Stanford University, would come up with the idea that the web could show how useful a certain link was to the users by seeing the number of times a website was linked to other sites. By ranking search results based on the popularity of that website, it would help the users have a better search experience when using a search engine. This was the core foundation for the company that Larry Page cofounded with fellow student Sergey Brin as Google.
            </p>
            <p>As another search engine, Google also faced the dilemma of how to make money off of search engines. Yet, Google’s founders did not want to be like another Yahoo. Instead, Google essentially copied the idea from a website called Overture, which was created by Bill Gross, the founder of Idealab. Gross’ idea was that when a user typed in a keyword in a search engine, it was indicative of their interest. In other words, it was a way to show what users might be interested in buying. Therefore, companies looking to sell their products could sell a keyword to determine the placement of their ads when the keyword is typed into the search engine. This proved to be very effective in differentiating Google’s search engine and Yahoo’s search engine in terms of user experience for relevant searches to the keyword.
            </p>
            <p>While Google has established itself to be one of the most useful search engines, it also brought about fears of invasion of privacy. How much of your personal information could be stored on Google’s databases? This is a conflict that is still relevant today and will certainly continue to be a concern for all users.
